# MVC: The Model View Controller

An introduction to MVC.

## What is MVC?

MVC is an architectural pattern in software design that is used to separate an application into three main logical components:
- Model: Handles the database.
- View: Handles the front end.
- Controller: Handles the server-side logic.

## Why use MVC?

Just as separation of concerns helps us on the front end, MVC helps us on the back end. This separation allows for more organized, modular and maintainable code. Encapsulation makes debugging easier, and the organization helps make our application easier to understand. This sort of structure can greatly reduce friction when collaborating with a team and make everyone's lives easier.

## What does it look like?

Don't like flowcharts? Well, I hope you like analogies. Lets imagine MVC as a city. The Model would be the infrastructure - the underlying data that make the city function. The View would be the buildings, landmarks, and architecture -  what the users see and interact with. The Controller would be the traffic lights and road signs - controlling how users move through the city and interact with the buildings and infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, MVC is just a way to organize your code. It separates the different parts of your app so each one can be worked on independently. This makes it less of a headache to update and maintain. Overall, it makes development a smoother process for individuals as well as teams.
